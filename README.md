## About
[Back To The Top](#table-of-contents)

Ink&Read is a website for avid readers to be part of a vibrant community of readers. The members can view books available on the website, learn more about each book and see what the community members are rating and reviewing it. Members of the community can also submit their reviews for books, whilst non-members have view-only access to the ratings and reviews.

Admins can upload new books, approve reviews and create content for each book page, including details about the book. 

Members of the website can also create a wishlist for books they'd like to read or mark books as 'read'. In the member profile page, logged in users can view their wishlist and track the books they have read. Users can also see this on each individual book page whether they have previously added the book to their wishlist or marked that book as read. Admins can manage user profile lists, including the 'wishlist' and 'read' list.

### Wireframes

I  used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to make wireframes for different screen layouts for my website design, and create mockups for mobile screen and laptop/desktop screen users. The wireframes helped to create an initial vision of how the website would look and feel. The finished website took inspiration from the mockups and built on top of it, hence the final result may differ from the wireframes constructed in the initial planning stages.

### Agile Methodology
Explain your agile approach to your project and insert screenshoots of your Kanban board (iterations, user stories, tasks,acceptance criteria, labels, story points...)

The agile approach for my project was to create a kanban board to track the status of the issues for the project. Each issue was prioritised using the MoSCow labels (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have) to streamline the issues, and focus on completing the issues with higher priority first. Each issue correlated to a user story, with an acceptance criteria list of what it would require for each user story to be considered complete. 

The Kanban board was structured into three different stages:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

Link to the project [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/GurpritK/projects/9/views/1) 

### Typography

For the logo and main headings of Ink&Read, I chose the Cedarville Cursive font. Its handwritten, flowing style evokes the warmth and personality of classic handwritten notes or vintage book inscriptions, giving the site a touch of literary charm and nostalgia.

For the body text and general content, I selected EB Garamond, a timeless serif typeface known for its elegance, readability, and historical connection to traditional print. Together, these two fonts create a balanced aesthetic â€” the cursive lends character and creativity, while Garamond ensures clarity and a polished, modern reading experience.

This pairing was carefully chosen after testing several options; the goal was to capture the feeling of an inviting library or cherished personal bookshelf, while maintaining a professional and accessible interface that supports effortless navigation and reading.

### Colour Scheme and Design Choices

I wanted to create a cosy library nook feeling on this virtual website and employed warm neutral tone colours and wooden textures to evoke this. The primary colours used were muted shades of green, and the font colours were muted pale yellow shades and browns. I generated an AI image with prompts to bring my vision to life of a welcoming reading area for a community of readers, creating a cohesive look with the hero image tying the website together.

I shifted the navbar to the left hand side of the page, rather than keep it at the top. By removing the navbar from the top, my aim was to create website which would feel less corporate.

The inspiration colour palette was generated using [Coolors](https://www.coolors.co). However, as I developed and designed the website, I tweaked and experimented with other colours so the website palette may not be an exact palette of the original palette selected. There are still elements of the original palette within the website, but I incorporated more shades of yellows.

<details>
  <summary>Colour Palette</summary>

  </details>

### Entity Relationship Diagram
I used [Eraser](https://www.eraser.io/ai/erd-generator) to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The relationships between the tables are drawn.

<details>
  <summary>Homepage Navbar</summary>

  ![Home Page Navbar](static/images/features/home-navbar.jpeg)
  
  </details>

For smaller screens, like mobiles and tablets, there is a fixed navbar the the top of the screen with a hamburger icon for the menu dropdown. This navbar is accessible on all pages:

<details>
  <summary>Mobile Navbar</summary>

  ![Mobile Navbar](static/images/features/mobile-navbar.jpeg)
  
  </details>

From the navbar, users can navigate to the book collection and their own profiles. If they are logged in, they have the menu option to 'log out'. If they are not signed in, the navbar updates to provide menu options to 'sign up' and 'log in':

<details>
  <summary>Smart Navbar</summary>

  ![Smart Navbar](static/images/features/smart-navbar.jpeg)
  
  </details>

From the book collection page, users can navigate to individual books to read more about each book, as well as add ratings and reviews. Within each book page, the user can also add the book to a 'wishlist' or mark it as 'read'. 

Similarly, users can navigate to books from their own profile from the navbar.


### Footer

In the footer, there are some quick links to the homepage, and the book collection page. There is a small description about the Ink&Read website, and social media links. Currently there are empty links which simply navigate to the hompages of the social media websites. 

<details>
  <summary>Footer</summary>

  ![Footer](static/images/features/footer.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### Home-page

The homepage displays a beautiful and inviting hero image which creates a warm, welcoming inviting for readers. Here you have some CTA buttons to 'explore books' or 'sign up' or 'log in':

<details>
  <summary>Buttons Logged Out</summary>

  ![Buttons Logged Out](static/images/features/home-buttons-loggedout.jpeg)
  
  </details>

The 'sign up' and 'log in'  buttons are removed and replaced if the user is logged in to a 'log out' button:

<details>
  <summary>Buttons Logged In</summary>

  ![Buttons Logged In](static/images/features/home-buttons-loggedin.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Below the hero section, there is more information about the site and everything you can use the site for. This information is split and displayed in a grid for an easier to digest format:

<details>
  <summary>About Grid</summary>

  ![About Grid](static/images/features/about-grid.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Near the bottom of the homepage, there is a section for 'book of the week' which updates according to the most recent highly rated book:

<details>
  <summary>Featured Book</summary>

  ![Featured Book](static/images/features/featured-book.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### Book-collection-page

The book collection page displays all the book included in the website in a grid display. Within each book grid/card, the book cover, book title, a truncated description of the book and author name is visible:

<details>
  <summary>Book Collection Grid</summary>

  ![Book Collection Grid](static/images/features/books.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Additionally, a rating display for each book is also visible:

<details>
  <summary>Individual Book Rating</summary>

  ![Individual Book Rating](static/images/features/book-rating.jpeg)
  
  </details>


If a book has no ratings, this is also shown in the book card:

<details>
  <summary>Individual Book No Rating</summary>

  ![Individual Book No Rating](static/images/features/book-norating.jpeg)
  
  </details>


Logic is applied to calculate and display the average rating score for each book in the individual book card. It is possible to click on any book, and navigate to the book details page.


### Book-detail-page

The book detail page is where you can see the full description of each book, book cover and also the other details like author and title:

<details>
  <summary>Book Details</summary>

  ![Book Details](static/images/features/book-details.jpeg)
  
  </details>


On this page, you will find the average rating of a book and reviews left by other users:

<details>
  <summary>Book Detail Average Rating</summary>

  ![Book Detail Average Rating](static/images/features/book-score.jpeg)
  
  </details>


Logged in users can also give a rating and submit a review. If the logged in user has previously submitted either a review or rating, it can also be updated or deleted from this page:

<details>
  <summary>Submit Rating or Review</summary>

  ![Submit Rating or Review](static/images/features/submit-rating-or-review.jpeg)
  
  </details>

 
The reviews are only displayed after approval:

<details>
  <summary>Review Approval Message</summary>

  ![Review Approval Message](static/images/features/approval-message.jpeg)
  
  </details>


On this page, logged in users can add a book to their own wishlist, or mark a book as read:

<details>
  <summary>List Buttons</summary>

  ![List Buttons](static/images/features/list-buttons.jpeg)
  
  </details>


For logged out users, you can see everything linked to the book but cannot add reviews or ratings, or add the book to a wishlist or mark it as 'read'. In the space of where these buttons are available for logged in users, there is instead a message to 'log in' to 'complete action', where the action represents either of those fuctionalities.

<details>
  <summary>Limited Functionality</summary>

  ![Limited Functionality](static/images/features/limited-functionality.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### User-profile-page

Logged in users have their own member area, which they can navigate to directly from the navbar:

<details>
  <summary>Profile Area</summary>

  ![Profile Area](static/images/features/profile-section.jpeg)
  
  </details>

The link is personalised with the user's name e.g. "Gurprit's Profile":

<details>
  <summary>Personalised Message</summary>

  ![Personalised Message](static/images/features/personalised-message.jpeg)
  
  </details>

There is also a number tracker for their lists:

<details>
  <summary>List Number Tracker</summary>

  ![List Number Tracker](static/images/features/list-number-tracker.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Within the user profile, members can view their wishlist of books:

<details>
  <summary>Wishlist</summary>

  ![Wishlist](static/images/features/wishlist.jpeg)
  
  </details>
 
They can also track their reading by viewing books they have marked as 'read':

<details>
  <summary>Read List</summary>

  ![Read List](static/images/features/read-list.jpeg)
  
  </details>
 
 If there are no books in either list, there is CTA button to 'browse books' so that they can start curating their lists:

 <details>
  <summary>No Books inn List</summary>

  ![No Books in List](static/images/features/no-books-in-list.jpeg)
  
  </details>

**Future Improvement:** This profile area can be further improved in the future by allowing users to directly manage their lists from this page. However, they can make changes to their lists by clicking on a book from the profile area, and toggling the 'add to wishlist' or 'mark as read' buttons. This change will automatically update and reflect in the user profile page.

### CRUD

- Registered users can add a rating, update their rating and delete their rating for a book. When the user navigates the book page, they can also view the rating they submitted. When a user makes any of these changes, they are notified with an alert whether their action was successful. Each user is limited to one rating per book, and the option to 'update' their rating is available if a rating has already been submitted.

- Registered users can create reviews, update their reviews and delete their reviews for a book. When the user submits or updates a review, it is sent for approval to the admin. The user is notified that their review has been submitted for approval. When a user deletes their review, this change is applied immediately and the review will no longer be seen on the page. All reviews from all users are visible on the book page. Each user is limited to one review per book, and the option to 'update' their review is available only.

- To personalise the user experience further, registered users can navigate to a book page and 'add to wishlist'. This will add the book to their wishlist in their personal profile page. Users can easily remove a book from their wishlist by toggling the button on the book page. The change is reflected immediately on the book details page and in the user profile page too. The user is notified for each action. This feature is available to logged in users only.

- Similarly, as part of the personalised user experience, registered users can navigate to a book page and mark the book as 'read'. This will add the book to their 'read' books collection in their personal profile section. Users can easily mark the same book as 'unread' by toggling the 'read' button on the book details page. The change is reflected immediately on the book page. The user is notified for each action. This feature is available to logged in users only.


### Authentication-Authorisation 

- Django AllAuth: Django authentication/authorisation pages used for sign up, log in and log out pages. These were customised using the website's design theory. Admins can view and remove users from the admin section.

## Bugs
[Back To The Top](#table-of-contents)

List of bugs and how did you fix them
- I decided to rename an app from 'my_profile' to 'user_profiles' as this naming made more sense from the admin perspective when managing different user profiles. This involved creating the new app, moving models, views and existing templates across from the old app, and transferring any migration tables and data within the tables. Although the transfer of all these files and data, and deleting the old app was successful, the site was crashing with errors like 'not found'. When navigating to the profile page, there were errors referencing the old app. This suggested there were some stil some references to the old app remaining in the project. I looked through all the files, and eventually decided to lean on AI to find the remaining references and update them. Copilot AI was quick to identify that the URL paths in urls.py hadn't been updated. 

- I was making changes to the CSS files, but these were not appearing in the local web development browser. My initial thinking was that the CSS file was not properly connected to the html template files, and perhaps the script paths were incorrect but this was not the case. I did some further investigation to find what was missing (and a lot of hard refreshes!), AI also suggested some changes to make but I knew from my previous projects that the additional settings AI was recommending were not required. Finally, I found that the debug settings was set to FALSE (from my last commit to deploy the app to Heroku), hence the CSS was no longer showing on my local browser. Once I set it to TRUE, the CSS changes were immediately reflected in my local browser.

- When I deployed the app on Heroku, the styling was not being applied. I realised I had missed the step to deploy static files. The 'staticfiles' folder was missing from the project and some additional static file settings needed to be set in the settings.py folder. The whitenoise package had to be installed too. Finally, to collect static files I ran the collectstatic command in my terminal and these files were added to the base directory and folder name specifed when I set this in the settings.py using the STATIC_ROOT variable. 

- As I created more books for the book collection from the admin pages, by manually adding the book covers and details, I found that the display in the website was showing the HTML code within the descriptions for each book. This issue did not occur when I added the first book. By using 'safe' and 'striptags' tags in the HTML for book descriptions, I was able to fix this issue.

- I decided instead of a favourites list, I wanted to create a wishlist instead. I updated all the frontend code to reflect this in the text on the website, but since it used the same functionality in the backend code I decided to keep the model table the same, and keep the field 'is_favourite' to use for the wishlist. I could've updated the table, and migrated once and transferred existing data but since there was no fundamental change to the backend functionality, it made sense to keep the table name as is owing to time constraints. 

- A lot of issues using CSS and Bootstrap5 for responsive designing, with grids not displaying the book covers and descriptions clearly. In particular, on a mobile screen device, on the homepage the 'book of the week' section was cut in half. This same issue was not showing for the other pages, and the books were displaying correctly. I had created the book of the week grid differently to the other pages, as it displayed the book cover on the left hand side, and the description and ratings on the right. It was created this way to create a better flow for the homepage, and a more horizontal surface area, instead of vertical like the book collection page. To fix this, I...


### Bugs to fix 

- The alert box appears at the top of a page after a particular action, and after closing the box, it leaves behind a small margin at the top of the page. If the page is refreshed, this goes away, but I'd like for it to be gone immediately with the alert box closing.

- Rating input area creates a blue outline around the input type box, and the review textarea creates an outline if the colour I've set it to. Due to default browser settings or Bootstrap class styling, any changes to get the rating input area outline to match the review textarea outline were unsucessful. This is a future fix, as further investigation is required.

* Usage of AI for Code Development:
Copilot AI was a really helpful tool when setting up the inital file structure, such as the views, models, forms and templates. It was easily able to find inconsistencies, and help apply the correct code when the functionality did not work as expected.

* Usage of AI for CSS Development:
I used Copilot AI to create custom pages for the Django authorisation pages, and the error 404 pages by using the design and website colour schemes from the pages I had already designed. AI successfully created custom designs for those pages which were cohesive and synergised to the rest of the website. 

* Usage of AI for Debugging (Code and Layout Issues):
For smaller screen devices, I found Copilot AI was a great assistance. I'd identify the issue with the layout using Chrome Developer tools, and testing the required code to fix layout issues. I'd then apply those changes in style.css with the help of AI.

* Usage of AI for Testing:
I used AI to clean up code, and regularly asked AI to remove redundant code, find commented out code or find missing tags in HTMLs. These helpful changes helped me to clear warnings and errors which came up during validation testing.

* Usage of AI for Heroku Deployment:
Issue with the heroku deployed app not showing the styling I had applied. Copilot AI helped me by suggesting running the collectstatic command. I committed and pushed my changes to GitHub, and redeployed the app. The deployed app now had all the styling I had developed.
