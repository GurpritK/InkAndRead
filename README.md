## About
[Back To The Top](#table-of-contents)

Ink&Read is a website for avid readers to be part of a vibrant community of readers. The members can view books available on the website, learn more about each book and see what the community members are rating and reviewing it. Members of the community can also submit their reviews for books, whilst non-members have view-only access to the ratings and reviews.

Admins can upload new books, approve reviews and create content for each book page, including details about the book. 

Members of the website can also create a wishlist for books they'd like to read or mark books as 'read'. In the member profile page, logged in users can view their wishlist and track the books they have read. Users can also see this on each individual book page whether they have previously added the book to their wishlist or marked that book as read. Admins can manage user profile lists, including the 'wishlist' and 'read' list.

### Wireframes

I  used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to make wireframes for different screen layouts for my website design, and create mockups for mobile screen and laptop/desktop screen users. The wireframes helped to create an initial vision of how the website would look and feel. The finished website took inspiration from the mockups and built on top of it, hence the final result may differ from the wireframes constructed in the initial planning stages.

### Agile Methodology

The agile approach for my project was to create a kanban board to track the status of the issues for the project. Each issue was prioritised using the MoSCow labels (Must Have, Should Have, Could Have) to streamline the issues, and focus on completing the issues with higher priority first. Each issue correlated to a user story, with an acceptance criteria list of what it would require for each user story to be considered complete. 

The Kanban board was structured into three different stages:

- To Do
- In Progress
- Done

Link to the project [Kanban Board](https://github.com/users/GurpritK/projects/9/views/1) 

### Typography

For the logo and main headings of Ink&Read, I chose the Cedarville Cursive font. Its handwritten, flowing style evokes the warmth and personality of classic handwritten notes or vintage book inscriptions, giving the site a touch of literary charm and nostalgia.

For the body text and general content, I selected EB Garamond, a timeless serif typeface known for its elegance, readability, and historical connection to traditional print. Together, these two fonts create a balanced aesthetic â€” the cursive lends character and creativity, while Garamond ensures clarity and a polished, modern reading experience.

This pairing was carefully chosen after testing several options; the goal was to capture the feeling of an inviting library or cherished personal bookshelf, while maintaining a professional and accessible interface that supports effortless navigation and reading.

### Colour Scheme and Design Choices

The design strategy focused on creating a welcoming literary environment through careful color selection and layout decisions. The primary color palette uses muted greens with soft yellows and browns to establish a warm, library-inspired aesthetic.

The custom hero image reinforces the community reading theme and establishes visual consistency throughout the site. All color choices support the goal of creating an inviting space for book enthusiasts.

A key design decision involved relocating the navigation from the traditional top position to a left sidebar. This approach creates a more personal browsing experience while reducing the corporate feel commonly associated with standard web layouts.

The initial color palette was developed using [Coolors](https://www.coolors.co), though the final implementation evolved to incorporate additional yellow tones and warmer variations that better suited the literary theme.

### Entity Relationship Diagram
I used [Eraser](https://www.eraser.io/ai/erd-generator) to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). The relationships between the tables are drawn.

## Features:
[Back To The Top](#table-of-contents)

Screenshots of features below:

### Navigation

For larger screens like laptops and desktops, there is a fixed navbar on the left hand side of the website. The navbar is accessible and visible from all screens:

<details>
  <summary>Homepage Navbar</summary>

  ![Home Page Navbar](static/images/features/home-navbar.jpeg)
  
  </details>

For smaller screens, like mobiles and tablets, there is a fixed navbar the the top of the screen with a hamburger icon for the menu dropdown. This navbar is accessible on all pages:

<details>
  <summary>Mobile Navbar</summary>

  ![Mobile Navbar](static/images/features/mobile-navbar.jpeg)
  
  </details>

From the navbar, users can navigate to the book collection and their own profiles. If they are logged in, they have the menu option to 'log out'. If they are not signed in, the navbar updates to provide menu options to 'sign up' and 'log in':

<details>
  <summary>Smart Navbar</summary>

  ![Smart Navbar](static/images/features/smart-navbar.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### Footer

In the footer, there are some quick links to the homepage, and the book collection page. There is a small description about the Ink&Read website, and social media links. Currently there are empty links which simply navigate to the hompages of the social media websites. 

<details>
  <summary>Footer</summary>

  ![Footer](static/images/features/footer.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### Home-Page

The homepage displays a beautiful and inviting hero image which creates a warm, welcoming inviting for readers. Here you have some CTA buttons to 'explore books' or 'sign up' or 'log in':

<details>
  <summary>Buttons Logged Out</summary>

  ![Buttons Logged Out](static/images/features/home-buttons-loggedout.jpeg)
  
  </details>

The 'sign up' and 'log in'  buttons are removed and replaced if the user is logged in to a 'log out' button:

<details>
  <summary>Buttons Logged In</summary>

  ![Buttons Logged In](static/images/features/home-buttons-loggedin.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Below the hero section, there is more information about the site and everything you can use the site for. This information is split and displayed in a grid for an easier to digest format:

<details>
  <summary>About Grid</summary>

  ![About Grid](static/images/features/about-grid.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Near the bottom of the homepage, there is a section for 'book of the week' which updates according to the most recent highly rated book:

<details>
  <summary>Featured Book</summary>

  ![Featured Book](static/images/features/featured-book.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### Book-Collection-Page

The book collection page displays all the book included in the website in a grid display. Within each book grid/card, the book cover, book title, a truncated description of the book and author name is visible:

<details>
  <summary>Book Collection Grid</summary>

  ![Book Collection Grid](static/images/features/books.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Additionally, a rating display for each book is also visible:

<details>
  <summary>Individual Book Rating</summary>

  ![Individual Book Rating](static/images/features/book-rating.jpeg)
  
  </details>


If a book has no ratings, this is also shown in the book card:

<details>
  <summary>Individual Book No Rating</summary>

  ![Individual Book No Rating](static/images/features/book-norating.jpeg)
  
  </details>


Logic is applied to calculate and display the average rating score for each book in the individual book card. It is possible to click on any book, and navigate to the book details page.


### Book-Detail-Page

The book detail page is where you can see the full description of each book, book cover and also the other details like author and title:

<details>
  <summary>Book Details</summary>

  ![Book Details](static/images/features/book-details.jpeg)
  
  </details>


On this page, you will find the average rating of a book and reviews left by other users:

<details>
  <summary>Book Detail Average Rating</summary>

  ![Book Detail Average Rating](static/images/features/book-score.jpeg)
  
  </details>


Logged in users can also give a rating and submit a review. If the logged in user has previously submitted either a review or rating, it can also be updated or deleted from this page:

<details>
  <summary>Submit Rating or Review</summary>

  ![Submit Rating or Review](static/images/features/submit-rating-or-review.jpeg)
  
  </details>

 
The reviews are only displayed after approval:

<details>
  <summary>Review Approval Message</summary>

  ![Review Approval Message](static/images/features/approval-message.jpeg)
  
  </details>


On this page, logged in users can add a book to their own wishlist, or mark a book as read:

<details>
  <summary>List Buttons</summary>

  ![List Buttons](static/images/features/list-buttons.jpeg)
  
  </details>


For logged out users, you can see everything linked to the book but cannot add reviews or ratings, or add the book to a wishlist or mark it as 'read'. In the space of where these buttons are available for logged in users, there is instead a message to 'log in' to 'complete action', where the action represents either of those fuctionalities.

<details>
  <summary>Limited Functionality</summary>

  ![Limited Functionality](static/images/features/limited-functionality.jpeg)
  
  </details>


### User-Profile-Page

Logged in users have their own member area, which they can navigate to directly from the navbar:

<details>
  <summary>Profile Area</summary>

  ![Profile Area](static/images/features/profile-section.jpeg)
  
  </details>

The link is personalised with the user's name e.g. "Gurprit's Profile":

<details>
  <summary>Personalised Message</summary>

  ![Personalised Message](static/images/features/personalised-message.jpeg)
  
  </details>

There is also a number tracker for their lists:

<details>
  <summary>List Number Tracker</summary>

  ![List Number Tracker](static/images/features/list-number-tracker.jpeg)
  
  </details>

Within the user profile, members can view their wishlist of books:

<details>
  <summary>Wishlist</summary>

  ![Wishlist](static/images/features/wishlist.jpeg)
  
  </details>
 
They can also track their reading by viewing books they have marked as 'read':

<details>
  <summary>Read List</summary>

  ![Read List](static/images/features/read-list.jpeg)
  
  </details>
 
 If there are no books in either list, there is CTA button to 'browse books' so that they can start curating their lists:

 <details>
  <summary>No Books in List</summary>

  ![No Books in List](static/images/features/no-books-in-list.jpeg)
  
  </details>

**Future Improvement:** This profile area can be further improved in the future by allowing users to directly manage their lists from this page. However, they can make changes to their lists by clicking on a book from the profile area, and toggling the 'add to wishlist' or 'mark as read' buttons. This change will automatically update and reflect in the user profile page.

### CRUD

- Registered users can add a rating, update their rating and delete their rating for a book. When the user navigates the book page, they can also view the rating they submitted. When a user makes any of these changes, they are notified with an alert whether their action was successful. Each user is limited to one rating per book, and the option to 'update' their rating is available if a rating has already been submitted.

- Registered users can create reviews, update their reviews and delete their reviews for a book. When the user submits or updates a review, it is sent for approval to the admin. The user is notified that their review has been submitted for approval. When a user deletes their review, this change is applied immediately and the review will no longer be seen on the page. All reviews from all users are visible on the book page. Each user is limited to one review per book, and the option to 'update' their review is available only.

- To personalise the user experience further, registered users can navigate to a book page and 'add to wishlist'. This will add the book to their wishlist in their personal profile page. Users can easily remove a book from their wishlist by toggling the button on the book page. The change is reflected immediately on the book details page and in the user profile page too. The user is notified for each action. This feature is available to logged in users only.

- Similarly, as part of the personalised user experience, registered users can navigate to a book page and mark the book as 'read'. This will add the book to their 'read' books collection in their personal profile section. Users can easily mark the same book as 'unread' by toggling the 'read' button on the book details page. The change is reflected immediately on the book page. The user is notified for each action. This feature is available to logged in users only.


### Authentication-Authorisation

User authentication is handled through Django AllAuth, providing secure and reliable user management. The standard sign-up, login, and logout pages have been styled to match the site's cozy aesthetic.

Users can easily create accounts to unlock member features like rating books, writing reviews, and building personal reading lists. For site administrators, Django's admin panel provides full control over user accounts and content moderation, keeping the community friendly and spam-free.

## Bugs
[Back To The Top](#table-of-contents)

The following issues were encountered during development and their respective solutions:

**App Renaming Issues**
Renaming the 'my_profile' app to 'user_profiles' for improved clarity resulted in 'not found' errors despite successful file migration. Investigation revealed remaining references to the old app name in urls.py that required manual updating.

**CSS Loading Problems in Development**
CSS changes were not reflecting in the local development environment. The issue was traced to the DEBUG setting being set to FALSE (from a previous Heroku deployment), which prevented proper static file serving in development mode.

**Static Files Deployment Issues**
Styling appeared correctly in development but failed to load on Heroku deployment. The issue was resolved by implementing proper static file collection using `collectstatic` command and configuring WhiteNoise for static file serving.

**HTML Rendering in Book Descriptions**
Raw HTML code appeared in book descriptions when content was added through the admin interface. This was resolved by implementing Django's `striptags` template filter to properly render text content while preserving formatting capability in the admin.

**Database Field Naming Convention**
The frontend terminology was updated from "favorites" to "wishlist" for improved user experience, while maintaining the existing `is_favorite` database field name to avoid complex migrations and data loss.

**Responsive Layout Issues**
The "book of the week" section displayed incorrectly on mobile devices due to horizontal layout constraints. This was addressed through CSS media queries and proper Bootstrap grid implementation for responsive design.

### Future Improvements

**Form Input Styling Consistency**
The rating stars input maintains a default blue outline that does not conform to the custom styling applied to other form elements. This styling inconsistency could be addressed with additional CSS specificity.

## AI Reflections
[Back To The Top](#table-of-contents)

AI tools were utilized throughout this project to enhance development efficiency and code quality. The following outlines how AI assistance contributed to Ink & Read:

**Foundation Development**
GitHub Copilot provided assistance during initial setup, helping structure Django views, models, and templates. The AI identified inconsistencies and suggested appropriate fixes when issues arose during development.

**Design & Styling Implementation**
AI assistance was particularly effective in creating custom authentication and 404 error pages. By providing the existing color scheme and design patterns to Copilot, it generated consistent pages that maintained design cohesion across the site.

**Mobile Layout Resolution**
AI assistance proved valuable for responsive design challenges, particularly the mobile "book of the week" section. The AI translated DevTools observations into effective CSS solutions, streamlining the debugging process.

**Code Quality Assurance**
AI served as a quality control assistant, identifying redundant code, locating forgotten comment blocks, and catching missing HTML tags. This assistance significantly reduced time spent during testing validation phases.

**Deployment Troubleshooting**
When local styling failed to appear on Heroku, AI quickly identified the missing `collectstatic` step. The AI's systematic approach helped resolve deployment issues efficiently.
